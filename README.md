The flanagan library by Michael T. Flanagan
===========================================

This project builds flanagan.jar containing sources authored by Michael Thomas Flanagan.

There is no version number associated with the sources. The file most recently
modified by flanagan is Regression.java, modified 4-Feb-2011 per that file's headers.

Therefore the version 1.0.20110204 has been assigned in pom.xml.

Various copyright notices ranging from 2002 to 2011 are in the sources. The copyright
notice captured by github user [Steffen Dienst](https://github.com/smee), who did the
work to get the project to compile without errors under Java 8, is reproduced below.
